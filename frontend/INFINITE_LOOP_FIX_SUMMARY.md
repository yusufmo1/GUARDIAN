# Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing an infinite loop with the error:
```
RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

The browser console showed that 10 effect functions were repeatedly calling each other.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Old Svelte 4 Store Syntax in Toast Component
**File**: `src/lib/components/common/Toast.svelte`
**Issue**: Line 22 was using `$toastStore` which is Svelte 4 reactive store syntax
**Fix**: Changed to `toastStore.toasts` (proper Svelte 5 syntax)

```diff
- {#each $toastStore as toast (toast.id)}
+ {#each toastStore.toasts as toast (toast.id)}
```

### 2. Missing Toast Auto-Removal Effect
**Issue**: Toast auto-removal was commented as "handled by the store" but stores can't have effects in Svelte 5
**Fix**: Added proper auto-removal effect to Toast component with `untrack` to prevent reactive loops

```javascript
$effect(() => {
  const currentToasts = toastStore.toasts;
  
  currentToasts.forEach(toast => {
    if (!activeTimeouts.has(toast.id) && toast.duration && toast.duration > 0) {
      const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
        untrack(() => dismissToast(toast.id)); // Using untrack prevents loops
      }, toast.duration);
      
      activeTimeouts.set(toast.id, timeoutId);
    }
  });
  
  // Clean up timeouts for removed toasts
  activeTimeouts.forEach((timeoutId, toastId) => {
    if (!currentToasts.some(t => t.id === toastId)) {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
      activeTimeouts.delete(toastId);
    }
  });
});
```

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Effect Tracking Utility
Created `src/lib/utils/effect-tracker.ts` to help debug future effect loops:
- Tracks all effect runs with stack traces
- Warns when effects run too many times
- Provides detailed reports

### 2. Effect Best Practices
- Always use `untrack()` when modifying reactive state from within effects
- Use initialization flags to prevent effects from running multiple times
- Break out of reactive context with `setTimeout` or `queueMicrotask` when needed
- Avoid reading values that the effect also writes

### 3. Store Migration Guidelines
When migrating from Svelte 4 to 5:
- Replace all `$store` syntax with `store.property` access
- Move effects from stores to components
- Use getter functions instead of derived stores when needed

## Testing the Fix

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Check browser console for any "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors
4. Navigate between pages and trigger toasts
5. Use the effect debug page at `/effect-debug` to monitor effect runs

## Additional Debug Tools

- `/effect-debug` - Shows real-time effect tracking
- `window.effectTracker` - Global effect tracking utility (in dev mode)
- Browser DevTools Performance tab - Can show infinite loops as high CPU usage

The infinite loop should now be resolved!
